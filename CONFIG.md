# BSM Configuration

## Teensy
## Jumpers

Jumpers on BSM are used to create or break connections on the board. This allows to customize it to your needs.

Three kinds of Jumpers are used on the board
1. Black jumpers
    Black jumpers are freely configuable. They just break or create connections, mainly around the teensy. 
2. Red jumpers
    Red jumpers are danger jumpers! Take care when using these! These are used for configuring the powersupply and selecting between external power or usb power. It is possible to damage something with these, so think before jumping!
3. Blue jumpers
    blue jumpers are selection jumpers. They are used in certain places to select configuration, for example to configure the stepper driver or h-bridge.
